# PyCitySchools
Written Report:

After anaylzing the results for the PyCitySchools, it is apparent that Charter schools have a higher passing rate
than district schools. 

It is also apparant that Charter schools have less students than District schools.
 
This could lead to the higher passing curve than district schools, but it is a huge difference in percentage rate. 
Which you could conclude that students in Charter schools have a higher passing rate than district schools.

We could also see the schools budget in Distric schools are higher than Charter, even though District schools are
not showing a progresss in passing rates. 

Another thing that I noticed is that Reading Scores are typically higher than Math Scores. Which shows that even if a
student struggles in Math, they are most likely not struggling with reading.
